# Deep_learning_challenge

## Objective
The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate the performance of deep learning neural networks in predicting applicants' success if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Technologies
* Python
* Sklearn
* Google colab
* Pandas

## Instruction:
Preprocess the data using Pandas and scikit-learns StandardScaler().
Compile, Train, and Evaluate the model.
  * Using the knowledge ofTensorFlow, design a neural network or deep learning model to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded oranization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.
Optimize the model.
 * Using your knowledge of TensorFlow, optimize your model to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75% using any of the following method:
    * Dropping more or fewer columns.
    * Creating more bins for rare occurrences in columns.
    * Increasing or decreasing the number of values for each bin.
    * Add more neurons to a hidden layer.
    * Add more hidden layers. 
    * Use different activation functions for the hidden layers.
    * Add or reduce the number of epochs to the training regimen.
